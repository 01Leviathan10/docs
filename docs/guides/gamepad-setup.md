# Gamepad Setup

RetroArch is intented to be easily controlled with a gamepad.

## Setting up a Gamepad

XINPUT controllers should work out of the box. If the controller can be autoconfigured the OSD will inform you of the autoconfiguration event. We also include autoconf profiles for many popular controllers. However not all controllers have these autoconfigs, if this is your case follow this guide:

- Navigate to **Settings**
- Navigate to **Input**
- Navigate to **Input User 1 Binds**
- Select **User 1 Bind All**
- Press the buttons as required

!!! tip
    If you have several different controller types you may want to use the **User 1 Save Autoconfig** followed by **User 1 Bind Default All** options after binding in order to achieve hotplug functionality

## Setting up controllers for multi-player 

If you want to set-up local multi-player with games that supports it:

- Navigate to **Settings**
- Navigate to **Input**

Here you will find the option to set binds for multiple users, "Input User 1 Binds", "Input User 2 Binds" and so on.

So lets set-up User 1's controller:

- Navigate to **Input User 1 Binds**
- Select **User 1 Device Index**

From here using the left/right buttons, select which currently plugged-in controller will be assigned to what player. While here you should also bind the controls to this player by pressing them on the assigned controller, Select **User 1 Bind All** to do this.

After you finish, go back, select **Input User 2 Binds** and repeat for user 2.
